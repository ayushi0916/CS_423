# Nearest Earth Objects

"In this project, I harnessed the power of various Python models, including KNN, logistic regression, XGBoost, and ANN, to achieve a remarkable 90% accuracy in analyzing Near-Earth objects. I worked with a substantial dataset of 85k records sourced from NASA's authoritative asteroid database.

The journey involved optimizing the dataset by strategically reducing columns to focus on the most pertinent features. To ensure the integrity of the analysis, I skillfully executed downsampling techniques and skillfully conducted comprehensive data wrangling, ensuring the data was primed for modeling.

With the dataset finely prepared, I embarked on the crucial stage of model development. Leveraging a combination of machine learning techniques, I meticulously fine-tuned each model for maximum accuracy and efficiency, ensuring they were production-ready.

This project not only showcased the prowess of Python models in this critical analysis but also demonstrated my proficiency in data preprocessing, model selection, and optimization. The end result is a robust set of models capable of providing valuable insights into Near-Earth objects while serving as a testament to my expertise in the data science domain."
